# LUA-Modules
All modules are based of LUA standardization of code for Liquipedia and its various wikis. Each folder is a different wiki and each folder is a different aspect of code. 

Liquipedia is a wiki program founded by the esports team 'Team Liquid', specializing in Esports wikis. Each wiki is based off a common code base, and the LUA modules in this Repo are standardized versions for each wiki. 

# Code Folders
## Match2
The newest bracket formatting developed by the Liquipedia devs, named Match2 as a version 2 for the Match bracket and list formatting. Each new wiki is built to work off of the new Match2 versions and require several wiki specific modules to work correctly.
## Info
Modules housing information about the wiki such as default game images and short/long names. 
## Infoboxes
Players, Teams, Leagues and more pages have infoboxes on the right hand side displaying important information. Before each wiki had different code for each infobox, but the standardized version are based off the common version and the wiki specific versions only house code thats specific for that wiki.

# Current workings of each esport wiki:

## Rainbow Six
- Infobox 

## Halo
- Info

## Splitgate
- Match2
